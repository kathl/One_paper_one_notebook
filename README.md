# One paper - One notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, i which I test how far I get with my data analysis if I only use one Jupyter notebook. This is interesting with respect to future Science Platforms: If I can't do my science on my local machine anymore, because the amount of data I would have to push around would be too big, what do I need on the Science Platform to accomplish my scientific goals?

Also I want to find out how much dust do HI-rich galaxies contain?
